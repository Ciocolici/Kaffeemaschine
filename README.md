# Kaffeemaschine
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. My first OOP (object-oriented programming) project. It simulates a refill program for a coffee machine.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Kaffeemaschine.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0".*

*Note: german language used.*
