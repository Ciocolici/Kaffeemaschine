# Kaffeemaschine
A C# (CSharp) Console App project. My first OOP (object-oriented programming) project. It simulates a refill program for a coffee machine.

Open "Kaffeemaschine.sln" to see the code. To run the Console App program directly, launch "Kaffeemaschine.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0". 

Note: german language used.
